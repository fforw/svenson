svenson json library change log:
================================

Changes from 1.2.7 to 1.2.8:

 * embarassing failure to account for Beans as properties of other beans fixed. Thanks to Dave Bordoley for finding this.

Changes from 1.2.6 to 1.2.7:

 * fix for stupid quote char quoting bug when using a single quote as JSON quoting character
 * Added parsing from and to enums. Enums generate their name is String value and can be parsed from such a String.
 * bugfix: prevent writing to java bean properties with named @JSONProperty with their old, now invalid name.
 * rename DynamicPropertiesUtil to JSONBeanUtil (keep DynamicPropertiesUtil as deprecated)

Changes from 1.2.5 to 1.2.6:

 * Make DynamicPropertiesUtil support maps, too.
 * bugfix: remove trailing comma in JSON output for DynamicProperties objects whose java bean properties all happen to be ignored.

Changes from 1.2.4 to 1.2.5:

 * Make DynamicPropertiesUtil always use JSON names, which was the initial purpose of writing it -- having a dynamic way to handle all JSON properties.


Changes from 1.2.3 to 1.2.4:

 * fixed bug with java class properties
 * fixed bug where you couldn't feed an JSON array to a DynamicProperties object
 * added org.svenson.util.DynamicPropertiesUtil to handle the java beans of DynamicProperties objects dynamically.


Changes from 1.2.2 to 1.2.3:

 * the parsePathInfo is now composed of the original JSON property names and not the java property names like it was before. 
 * added a small token logger 


Changes from 1.2.1 to 1.2.2:

 * allow JSONParser to be configured to accept single quotes as JSON quotes

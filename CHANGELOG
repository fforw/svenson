svenson json library change log:
================================

Changes from 1.4.4 to 1.4.5:
* Fix one but regarding typemappers ( commit f1618dd...)

Changes from 1.4.3 to 1.4.4:
* Change behavior of slash escape. Only escape slashes preceeding a < as a compromise between HTML pages and bad URL parsing.
* Introduce property priorities and @JSONPropertyOrder.

Changes from 1.4.2 to 1.4.3:
* Minor bugfixes and stabilization
* Corrected encoding bug where svenson would deviate from RFC 4627s strange ISO control
  character definitions.
* Make svenson more picky about detecting adders. Setters and adders are mutually exclusive now. 
* Improve error reporting for setter, getter and adder methods

Changes from 1.4.0 to 1.4.2:
* Stabilized ObjectSupport API
* ISO control character handling follows RFC now
* Adder methods fixed
* Overloaded method misdetection was fixed. 

Changes from 1.3.8 to 1.4.0:

* major refactoring of type knowledge and bean operations resulting in large performance
gians
* ObjectSupport/JSONPropertyInfo interfaces allow integrating of different objects/APIs/languages.


Changes from 1.3.7 to 1.3.8:
 * fixed PrefixPathMatcher and SuffixPathMatcher. Tests were wrong.
 * documentation additions
 * more tests
 * mainly coordinating release with jcouchdb 1.0.1-1
 
Changes from 1.3.6 to 1.3.7:
 
 * use BigDecimal for larger than long or fractional numbers
 * @JSONReference mechanism to dump only a replacement value for linked values.
 * Support for JavaScript-like property-path access to java object graphs ( org.svenson.util.JSONPathUtil )  

Changes from 1.3.5 to 1.3.6:

 * Support Set and Collection for JSONTypeHint. Intermediary list in JSON parser gets converted to HashSet. added Set => HashSet as known interface impl.
 * Support all standard JDK set implementation for @JSONTypeHint
 * Find best replacement interface, instead of taking the first possible. Fixes broken replacement interface behaviour
 * Add Array support
 * Properly regard initial type mapping to enable SubType-Matched parsing from JSON root
 * Svenson no longer reads ignored properties. 

Changes from 1.3.4 to 1.3.5:

 * add support for non-annotation based TypeConversion. See org.svenson.JSON.registerTypeConversion(Class<?>, TypeConverter) and org.svenson.JSONParser.registerTypeConversion(Class, TypeConverter)
 * add SinkAwareJSONifier for sink based JSONifying
 * add default ignore properties. See org.svenson.JSON.setIgnoredProperties(Collection<String>)
 * change List<String> ignoredProps to Collection<String> ignoredProps to enable using Set<String> but keep source compatibility. 

Changes from 1.3.3 to 1.3.4:
 * Add a copy constructor to JSONParser that creates a copy of the JSONParser with the same config. Fixes serious bug in jcouchdb and other use cases.

Changes from 1.3.2 to 1.3.3:
 * added JSONConfig to represent both a parser and a generator config.
 * enable path matching based on previous type hint, add sub type matcher
 * took over common-beanutil-1.8 depedency from jcouchdb, refactored type conversion, Fixes Issue #5.

Changes from 1.3.1 to 1.3.2:
 * now uses slf4j as logging API
 * now available via Maven
 * support for interface based JSONifiers

Changes from 1.3.0 to 1.3.1:
 * support for streaming output 
 * added ClassNameBasedTypeMapper
 * added @JSONConverter annotation allowing you to convert bean properties
 * added PathMatcher to flexibilize type hints and type mappers.
   This feature was sponsored by QuinScape ( http://quinscape.de )
 * about 20% better JSON parser performance when parsing into map/list graphs

Changes from 1.2.8 to 1.3.0:

 * support for object factories implementing org.svenson.ObjectFactory
 * support for parsing JSON from a stream. 
 * large improvements on memory consumption. 
   ( See http://fforw.de/post/Memory_consumption_changes_in_svenson_1.3/ )
   
Changes from 1.2.7 to 1.2.8:

 * embarassing failure to account for Beans as properties of other beans fixed. Thanks to Dave Bordoley for finding this.

Changes from 1.2.6 to 1.2.7:

 * fix for stupid quote char quoting bug when using a single quote as JSON quoting character
 * Added parsing from and to enums. Enums generate their name is String value and can be parsed from such a String.
 * bugfix: prevent writing to java bean properties with named @JSONProperty with their old, now invalid name.
 * rename DynamicPropertiesUtil to JSONBeanUtil (keep DynamicPropertiesUtil as deprecated)

Changes from 1.2.5 to 1.2.6:

 * Make DynamicPropertiesUtil support maps, too.
 * bugfix: remove trailing comma in JSON output for DynamicProperties objects whose java bean properties all happen to be ignored.

Changes from 1.2.4 to 1.2.5:

 * Make DynamicPropertiesUtil always use JSON names, which was the initial purpose of writing it -- having a dynamic way to handle all JSON properties.


Changes from 1.2.3 to 1.2.4:

 * fixed bug with java class properties
 * fixed bug where you couldn't feed an JSON array to a DynamicProperties object
 * added org.svenson.util.DynamicPropertiesUtil to handle the java beans of DynamicProperties objects dynamically.


Changes from 1.2.2 to 1.2.3:

 * the parsePathInfo is now composed of the original JSON property names and not the java property names like it was before. 
 * added a small token logger 


Changes from 1.2.1 to 1.2.2:

 * allow JSONParser to be configured to accept single quotes as JSON quotes

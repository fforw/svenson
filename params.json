{"name":"Svenson","tagline":"flexible Java5 json parser / generator","body":"# Svenson\r\n\r\nsvenson is a Java5 JSON generator/parser. It lets you convert Java object graphs into JSON and vice versa. svenson offers an API and annotations to aid you in this.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Free choice of java side objects: From total generic list/map scenarios to mapping POJOs to/from JSON or a mix between those two, from JSON generation being something your classes handle themselves to something JSONifying them.\r\n\r\n* Annotations and interfaces to help you to create your own applications that work with JSON.\r\n\r\n* Quality Assurance with unit tests ensures svenson keeps working after changes.\r\n\r\n<wiki:gadget url=\"http://svenson.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/misc/svenson-wiki-gadget.xml\" width=\"639\" height=\"402\" border=\"0\" />\r\n\r\n## Javadoc\r\n[Current release javadoc](http://fforw.de/static/svenson-javadoc/)\r\n\r\n## Genesis\r\n\r\nThe initial code for svenson grew out of a simple generator tool class I once wrote for my projects. I wrote JSON parsing code while working on my own couchdb driver called [http://code.google.com/p/jcouchdb/ jcouchdb]. Later I decided to create a standalone svenson project because the outcome seemed to be sufficient for all kinds of scenarios not involving jcouchdb.\r\n\r\n## Svenson and slf4j\r\n\r\nSvenson now uses slf4j for logging, so you need to configure slf4j to log to your favourite logging API. see [http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html The slf4j manual] for details.\r\n\r\nIf you use slf4j-log4j12, you still need a valid log4j configuration. svenson (especially parsing) will be slowed down considerably when that log4j configuration is missing.\r\n\r\n### example log4j configuration\r\n    log4j.rootLogger=ERROR, Console\r\n\r\n    # uncomment to set svenson logging to DEBUG\r\n    #log4j.logger.org.svenson=DEBUG\r\n\r\n    # log to the console\r\n    log4j.appender.Console=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender\r\n    log4j.appender.Console.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\r\n    log4j.appender.Console.layout.ConversionPattern=%-5p %c: %m%n\r\n\r\n## Maven Repository\r\n\r\nNow that we're sync by the big repositories, you just need to add the following dependency to your pom.xml:\r\n\r\n    <dependency>\r\n      <groupId>com.google.code.svenson</groupId>\r\n      <artifactId>svenson</artifactId>\r\n      <version>1.4.5</version>\r\n      <type>jar</type>\r\n    </dependency>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Improve Svenson\r\nI'm always interested in getting new ideas to improve my projects, so\r\nif your requirements are not met by svenson, you could try contacting me to give me a clearer idea of what could be added.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
